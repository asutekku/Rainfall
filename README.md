#Rainfall - a Cyberpunk clicker

>Tactical clicker inspired by the classic tabletop RPG Cyberpunk 2020 rulebooks.

This game was originally built with pure javascript but was changed to use typescript in the middle of the development. This allows better modular code and usage of ES6 features.

There are no additional dependencies so you can only clone and run tsc.
##Requirements
- Typescript compiler
